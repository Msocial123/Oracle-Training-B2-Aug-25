	1. Containerization
  ================

	Ø Monolithic architecture 
	Ø Microservices architecture 
	Ø Virtualization 
	Ø Docker vs Podman
	Ø Why container
	Ø What is container
	Ø Container architecture 
	Ø Container life cycle 
	Ø Registry 
	Ø Podman networks
	Ø Podman volumes 


	2. Containerization orchestration (k8s) 
  =================================

	Ø Why k8s
	Ø What is k8s
	Ø K8s history 
	Ø K8s features 
	Ø K8s architecture 
	Ø K8s :- ns, pod, rs, deployment, service, ingress, configmaps, secrets and helm.

Monolithic architecture
===================

Virtualization 
===========

	Ø It is a technology that allows you to run multiple os on a single physical machine by abstracting hardware resources 

Hypervisor
=========

	Ø It is act as a bridge between hardware and os , dividing cpu, memory,  storage and networking, so multiple vm's can run independently on a single physical machine.

Why virtualization 
===============

	1. Server utilization:- earlier, one server=one os= low utilizations, with virtualization one server can run 10+ vms > better hardware usage
	2. Isolation:- each vm is isolated , if one crahses, other vm's are safe
	3. Flexibility:- run windows, mac os, linux os on same physical machine
	4. Cost saving:- reduces need for physical servers 
	5. Agility :- east to create , clone, to take snapshot and migrate vm's

Types of virtualization 
==================

	1. Desktop virtaulation:- ex:- vmware 
	2. Storage virtualization:- combine multiple storage devices into one virtual pool
	3. Network vitualization :- virtual switches, firewalls, VLANS

=========================================================

What:- run multiple os/vm on one physical machine using a hypervisor

Why:- efficiency , cost saving, flexibility and isolation 

Impact:- foundation of cloud and DevOps era.


Types of Hypervisor
================

	1. Bare metal:- runs directly on the physical hardware (no underlying os)

	Ø Provides better performance, security and efficiency 
	Ø Common in data centres and entropies' virtualization 

Ex:- 
====

	1. Vmware 
	2. Microsoft hyper-v(when installed directly on hardware)
	3. Xen
	4. Kvm

	Ø Living directly in your own house


	2. Hosted Hypervisor:- it will run on top on existing os (windows, macos, linux)

	Ø Easier to use but has slight performance overhead since it relies on the host os
	Ø Good for personal use , development and testing 

Ex:-
===

	1. Oracle vb
	2. Vmware workstation
	3. Vmware fusion (for mac)
	4. Parallels desktop 

	Ø Like renting an apartment inside a building.


docker create 

podman create

docker run 

podman run

Why containerization 
==================


Docker vs podman
===============

Docker
======

	Ø Its a containerization platform 
	Ø Follows as client server architecture 
	Ø Docker client
	Ø Docker daemon 
	Ø Requires a background daemon to manage containers 
	Ø Docker can run ur containers as a root user only 

Root:- owner, group , others

	Ø By default some files or folders / repos has  read, write , executable 
	Ø 


Podman
=======

	Ø A daemonless container engine developed by REDHAT
Podman can run ur containers as a rootless for more secure, runs without root daemon 


# podman commands 

  19 podman build -t login:v1 .
  20 podman images
  21 podman run -d --name login-app -p 80:80 login:v1
  22 podman ps


  # container lifecylce commnads

  Container life cycle 
  ================
  Podman ps :- it will show only running containers
  
  podman create: - it will create the container only but wont start the container
  
  Podman ps -a:- it will show you all containers including stopped.
  
  podman start:- to start the container
  
  podman run:-  it will pull the image , it will create the container and it will start the container automatically 
  
  podman stop :- it will stop the container
  
  podman restart:- it will restart the container
  
  podman pause:- it will pause the container
  
  podman unpause:- it will unpause the container
  
  podman logs:- 
  
  podman exec -it :- to login into the container 
  
  podman inspect:- 
  
  Curl:- 
  
  podman rm :- it will remove only stopped containers 
  
  podman rm -f :- it will delete running containers
  
  podman rmi;- it will delete only unused podman images
  
  Podman rmi $(docker images -aq): it will unused podman images
  
  podman rmi -f  $(docker images -aq):
  
  podman  rm $(podman ps -a):- it will delete all stopped containers
  
  podman rm -f (podman ps -a):it will delete all stopped containers and running containers

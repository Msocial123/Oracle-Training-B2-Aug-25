========

	1. ClusterIP:- 

	Ø it is a default svc in any cluster
	Ø Whenever you want to expose the app within the cluster you can use clusterip svc type
	Ø It will expose ur app within a cluster only 
	Ø It will give one cluster ip add and you can't access the app outside the cluster
	Ø It is for prod use.


	2. NodePort:- 

	Ø It will expose the app on each node with static ip add 
	Ø You can access the app outside the cluster as well
	Ø It has port limitations, it allows you only port numbers between 30000 to 32767 on every node in a cluster
	Ø It is is only testing


	3. Load Balancer:-

	Ø It will expose the app outside the cluster
	Ø It will give an external ip add for accessing outside the cluster
	Ø There is no any port limitations 
	Ø It will give cost (it's not free)
	Ø Cloud provider will provide lb and its ip add
	Ø There will be a ip add limitations (you can't get ip add more than two)
	Ø It is used for temporary purpose 
	Ø Whenever you don’t have any domain name or you need to access the app outside the cluster without any port limitations.



	4. ExternalName:

	Ø It is a special type of svc in k8s
	Ø Instead of pointing to pods inside the cluster, it maps a svc name to an external dns name
	Ø It will work like a CNAMEr record in DNS
	Ø K8s does not create clusterip/nodeport for this svc type 
	Ø It just returns a CNAME alias to the client
